OpenCart is a free and open-source eCommerce platform. We have developed a payment extension for OpenCart that allows you to accept payments on your OpenCart store with Scanpay's payment platform.

This plugin is compatible with all versions of OpenCart 3. We are actively working on a new plugin for OpenCart 4.0.
